For the past two years, I have been doing lots of computational sketches that focused on visuals. This year, I am enrolled in a graduate course at ITP called the Code of Music, taught by [Luisa Pereira](https://www.luisapereira.net). I finally ran out of excuses for not experimenting with sound.

For this first experiment, we were prompted to build a simple audio visual instrument in p5.js.

Coincidentally, I have just recently started learning shader in p5.js following [this very well-structured course](https://shadertime.betamovement.net) by [Elie Zananiri](https://betamovement.net/about/). Before even writing any shaders, I was already amazed how I could use vertices to define a 3d mesh constructed by a triangle strip, specify a unique color at each vertex, and the 3d mesh will be filled with color gradients that interpolate these colors. With this idea in mind, I started experimenting with a donut-esque mesh by altering its level of details, animating its vertex colors, and applying oscillation to its vertices.

This served as a good foundation for my visual. Now it is time to choose audio.

I did not want my instrument to sound like a conventional instrument, so I was planning to record some random sounds. It came to my realization that I did not have time to identify sounds that I wanted to record, record them, and then edit them. So I turned to [freesound.org](https://freesound.org). I was searching for water sounds and came across [this very good quality paddle stroke sound pack](https://freesound.org/people/EpicWizard/packs/17730/).

This sound pack includes a decent collection of short paddle stroke sounds that I could use.

Following [this sample sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/luisa/sketches/9Gqsaazs2) from Luisa, I did some quick sketches to familiarize myself with tone.js.

Once acquinted with tone.js, I finally linked my audio to my visual.

In this version, I am wrapping the audio waveform around the mesh and applying it as a factor to the radius. In addition, the amplitude of the audio is applied as a factor to the amplitude of the oscillation.
