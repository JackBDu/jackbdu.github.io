At ITP, I took a class called Paper Enginnering and Interactive Play with Sam Ita. I was very excited to experiment with paper. Paper is such a ubiquitous medium, yet often overlooked.

One of my favorite components of this class was making popup books. For my first popup book, I took a very algorithmic approach and created a popup book out of repetition. It was a simple practice, but I was very happy with how it turned out.

For a more elaborate popup book, I wanted to create something more personal. Similar to the drummer automaton that I created last year, I decided to make a drummer popup book. It was inspired by the drummers in the Ansai Waist Drum performance, which is a traditional folk dance popular in my hometown.

First, I experimented with a few popup mechanisms for animating the drummer's arms.

I picked the closest one that reproduced the up and down motion. I made one for each arm with opposite motion. I also attempted to add a drum right below the arms.

In the next prototype, I added a bit more fidelity to the character design and made the drum stay in 3D when the book was fully open.

Finally, here is the final version with detailed facial features and a traditional towel headwear.
