Last Sunday, as a part of my first homework for a class called [Fabricating Mechanical Automatons \*Batteries Not Included](https://www.notion.so/9f357e279aa943ddaace71145300eb92?pvs=21), I set out on a quest for a small, inexpensive mechanical toy in around downtown Brooklyn. Two of the most common types that I found were windup vehicles and DIY mechanical kits. The latter tend to be big, complex, and out of my budget, whereas the former was a bit too basic. After visiting a variety of different stores, a cartoony windup caterpillar caught my eye. I bought it for about 8 dollars at a gift shop called [Exit9 Gift Emporium](https://goo.gl/maps/wJSzfjQYQBQC4nzHA). I really like it because of its simple cartoony look and its segmented body (more mechanical components to learn from). There were also some windup walking pigeons in the same store, but the art style was a little bit too detailed to my taste (though I am really interested in how the walking mechanism works, hopefully one of my classmates would buy something similar).

Here are some photos of this lovely toy:

Before opening it up, I closely evaluated how it works. I don’t remember when it was my last time to open up a windup toy, but I imagine there is probably a spiral spring inside that is twisted as I wind up the toy, which stores the energy which would then be released backwards as it moves. I noticed there is a small piece of plastic stab attached to only one of the wheels. For every turn the wheel rotates, the stab pushes one side of the next segment, which makes the that segment wiggle. The last two segments near the rear seem to move freely, so their movements mostly come from the segment that is constantly pushed around.

Enough speculation. It’s time to open it up!

I started by removing all five screws. It turns out all parts still seem very much intact at this point.

From the seam, I was able to split it into two chuck of parts.

After fiddling with it a bit more, I was able to dissemble all components and knoll them on the table.

I decided to take pictures of both side because the two sides are quite different from each other.

This last picture is taken after I reassembled the toy (believe it or not). I just couldn't resist to take one more photo of it.

It was quite a fun activity. There were more components than I originally thought. For instance, I did not think too much about the two different colors present on the toy. It turns the two individual plastic pieces are always in one color, which means the dark blue parts are separate from the light blue parts. My guess is that it is easier and more cost effective to make plastic pieces of the same color, so pieces of different colors are manufactured separately and then assembled together. Somehow, I also didn’t expect an enclosed windup gearbox. I think it might also have something to do with the cost. It is probably cheaper to incorporate standard windup gearboxes that are mass produced in millions of units. If I were to design my own windup toy, I should probably also buy similar components so I do not have to reinvent the wheel. This reminds me of the idea of encapsulations in computer programming, which helps programmers reuse useful code written by other programmers. All that being said, in this class, I hope I will get to learn all the inner-workings of automatons, including any windup gears. That will be so much fun!
