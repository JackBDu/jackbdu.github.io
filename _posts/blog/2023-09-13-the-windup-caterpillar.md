Last Sunday, as a part of my first homework for a class called [Fabricating Mechanical Automatons \*Batteries Not Included](https://www.notion.so/9f357e279aa943ddaace71145300eb92?pvs=21), I set out on a quest for a small, inexpensive mechanical toy around downtown Brooklyn. Two of the most common types of mechnanical toys that I found were windup vehicles and DIY mechanical kits. The latter tend to be bulky, complex, and out of my budget, whereas the former was a bit too basic. After visiting a variety of different stores, a cartoony windup caterpillar caught my eye. I bought it for about 8 bucks at a gift shop called [Exit9 Gift Emporium](https://goo.gl/maps/wJSzfjQYQBQC4nzHA). I really like it because of its simple cartoony look and its segmented body (more mechanical components to learn from). There were also some windup walking pigeons in the same store, but the art style was a little bit too detailed to my taste (though I am really interested in how the walking mechanism works, hopefully one of my classmates will buy something similar).

Here are some orthographic photos of this lovely toy:

Before opening it up, I closely examined the toy. I don't remember when it was my last time to open up a windup toy, but I imagine there is probably a spiral spring inside that is being twisted as I turn the windup knob, which stores the energy that will then be released backwards. I noticed there is a small piece of plastic stick attached to one of the wheels. For every turn the wheel rotates, the stick pushes one side of the immediately attached body segment, which makes that segment wiggle sideways. The last two segments near the rear end seem to move freely, so their movements mostly likely come from the segment before them.

Enough speculation. It’s time to open it up!

I started by removing all five screws from the bottom side of the body segments. It turned out all parts still seemed to be very much intact at this point.

From the seam, I was able to split it into two parts.

The head was a bit tricker. After fiddling with it a bit more, I was able to dissemble all components and organize them on the table.

Below are all of its components with names that I gave them:

I took pictures of both sides of the components because the two sides were quite different from each other.

This last picture was taken after I reassembled the toy. Yes, I was able to put it back together and I couldn't resist to take one more photo of this cute little caterpillar toy.

It was quite a fun activity. There were more components than I originally thought. For instance, I did not think too much about the two different colors present on the toy. It turns out each individual plastic piece is always in one color (except for the face, which is painted). For example, the dark blue decoration rings are separate from the light blue body segments. I suspect that is because it is easier and more cost effective to make plastic pieces of the same color. Pieces of different colors are manufactured separately and then assembled together in a separate process. Also, I didn’t expect an enclosed windup gearbox. I think it might also have something to do with the cost. It is probably cheaper to incorporate standard windup gearboxes that are mass produced in millions of units. This strategy reminds me of modularity in computer programming, which helps programmers reuse useful code written by other programmers without understanding what's happening under the hood. All that being said, in this class, I hope I will get to learn all the inner-workings of automatons, including any windup mechanism. Can't wait to learn more in this class!
