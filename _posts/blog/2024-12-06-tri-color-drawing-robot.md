My previous drawing robots have a very simple mechansim for holding markers—either a series of holes on [Minus E](https://jackbdu.com/works/minus-e/) or a tube on [Scribbot](https://jackbdu.com/blog/drawing-robot-redesigned/). There was also no lifting mechanism, as my robots' scribbly drawing style did not require it. This year, inspired by the pen-holding mechansim on pen plotters, I decided to add a similar mechansim to my drawing robot.

I added three of them—both to keep the symetrical aesthetics of Scribbot, and to let the robot draw with three different colors simulatenously. Since they can be individually lowered and lifted, the new creative possibilities are more than tripled.

Here is the first working prototype of this new robot.

In the next revision, I moved battery holders to its exterior for easy access, and added a large "hat" for AprilTag placement.

Here are some photos from its first public appearance at 370 Jay Street in Brooklyn, NY.

For the show, I chose to let the robot draw a circle over and over again in its signature scribbly style. Visitors kept coming back to check on the progress—the circle bacame more and more visible as the scribbles formed higher contrast.
