Mandarinizer started as a [command-line application](https://github.com/jackbdu/mandarinizer) that converts an image file to a text file containing a grid of Mandarin Chinese characters that gives the impression of the original image. It was one of [a series of experiments](/works/shirkys-eye/) that served as a proof of concept that the impression of an image can still be formed when pixels are replaced by a variety of different elements according to how dark each pixel is.

Later, I expanded its use to videos, and then to webcam stream so it can show a “Mandarinized” image of what the webcam sees in real time. Since it only had a command-line interface, you could only use it in a terminal emulator, such as the Terminal app on macOS. Eventually, I decided to completely rewrite it to be a [web app](https://github.com/jackbdu/mandarinizer/tree/gh-pages) so it can easily run on a mobile phone. In addition, you can enter your own characters to be used
by Mandarinizer.

That made it possible for me to keep Mandarinizer in my pocket all the time, so I took a lot of pictures with it. Here is a selection of them:
