In April 2020, as the Arts & Humanities Capstone Festival was going online amid COVID-19 pandemic, I (developer) collaborated with my colleague, [Erin Collins](https://www.erinmeekhof.com/) (designer), to produce this website to serve as the virtual venue, which also housed the event in the following year.

Despite the short timeframe (less than a month), I implemented this website with a focus on the simplification of its backend—all website data is stored in a Google spreadsheet in an well-organized format so my colleagues coordinating this event, who do not have any web development or management background, can update the website easily in real time by editing this spreadsheet.
