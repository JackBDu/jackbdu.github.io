As a new year resolution, I challenged myself to create and post computational sketches on social media every single day starting on January 1st, 2022. I use it as a way to journal, turning ideas, memories, and everyday events into expressive visuals. Some visuals are in simple geometric shapes and representational forms, some are in generative, repetitive, and abstract patterns, others are combinations of both. Most sketches are either still images or short animations, and the rest are interactive. The interactive ones are what I call virtual mirrors, which are sketches that are dynamically rendered in real time based on the presence of viewers. The images and motions of the viewers are first captured by a video camera, and then reinterpreted by the code that I wrote before shown to the viewers.

Most sketches started with a simple ideaâ€”a single circle, a blob, or some random scribbles. I would then spend anytime from a few days to a few weeks on these ideas by making incremental changes every day, altering colors, sizes, rotations, number of repetitions, etc. These changes often lead to unexpected results that are even surprising to me. Doing these sketches helped me practice my old coding skills as well as pick up many new techniques. It has also been a great source of inspiration for future project ideas.

Below I am showing a selection of my daily sketches based on different techniques I used.

## Scribbles

Some of the first daily sketches I created were inspired by drawings created by [Minus E](/works/minus-e/), a robotic drawing system I built in 2017. Essentially, these sketches were a recreation of Minus E's drawing style, forming images with a single thread of scribble that clusters in different densities at different spots. No longer constrained by hardware and time limitations, what surprised me the most was how easily I could bring these sketches to life by animating them.

Near the end of the year, I revisited this idea by recreating a similar [digital painting style](/works/digital-self-portraits/) I experimented with in 2019. Again, I was pleasantly surprised by the ability to animate as well as the flexibility of experimenting with different ways to connect the scribbles. In the end, I turned it into a virtual mirror that constantly regenerates new images in real time based on the presence of a viewer.

## Repetitions

One other series of experiments I did was with repetition. I started off with simple repetitions of small hollow circles in a spiral pattern. Iterations after iterations, I realized the pattern became much more interesting as repetitions were more ordered and as gaps between hollow contours got smaller.

When gaps were completely eliminated, seamless color gradients were formed, which gave these sketches a very natural look. Afterwards, I also experimented with using Perlin noise to generate more organic shapes and overlapping shapes by different amounts.

When I revisited this idea four months later, I decided to go with a more flowery look.

These are just a few examples of the ideas that I explored in 2022. To view all my daily sketches, please [visit my Instagram](http://instagram.com/jackbdu/). I will keep creating and posting daily sketches in the coming years.
