## About Interactive Media

[Interactive Media](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/academic-programs/interactive-media.html) (IM) is an interdisciplinary undergraduate program at [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/) (NYUAD) that combines art, interaction design, communications, computer science, and engineering.

IMâ€™s mission aims to make sense of technological developments by demystifying their inner-workings and leveraging them as a means for creative expression, communication, and participation.

## Project Background

As a program that attempts to keep pace with the latest transformative technologies, IM needs an update-to-date and user-friendly website that reflects this attempt while etablishing a professional and attractive public image.

The website is primiarily targeted at NYUAD students, faculty, and staff, for accessing IM-specific information and resources. Additionally, the website also provides information of the program for the public, such as prospective students and potential partners.
