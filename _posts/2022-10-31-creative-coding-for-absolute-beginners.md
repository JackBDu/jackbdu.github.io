2022 \| [Creative Coding Workshop](https://www.dubaidesignweek.ae/programme/2022/creative-coding/) at at Dubai Design Week, Dubai, UAE |

In early 2022, I was invited by organizers of [Sikka Art and Design Festival](https://sikkartandesign.com), an annual event housed in Al Fahidi Historical Neighborhood in Dubai, to teach workshops at the event. I decided to offer [two introductory creative coding workshops](https://sikkartandesign.com/Creative-Coding-Workshop) that teach participants how to use [p5.js](http://p5js.org), a creative coding framework that focuses on making code accessible and inclusive. These workshops were very successful, with participants ranging from professionals to elementary school students and stay-at-home moms. I was very touched by the enthusiasm of the participants, which inspired me to offer two [similar workshops](https://www.dubaidesignweek.ae/programme/2022/creative-coding/) at [Dubai Design Week](https://www.dubaidesignweek.ae) in late 2022.

In addition, I also developed and taught a series of beginner-friendly creative coding workshops to community members at New York University Abu Dhabi. This series consists of three workshops: the first workshop provides an overview of creative coding and gets participants started with sketching using p5.js, the second workshop demonstrates how repetition can be used to create mesmerizing patterns and seamless transitions, and the third workshop introduces Perlin noise, an algorithm that helps to make sketches appear more organic and natural. In all these workshops, I try to encourage participants to experiment freely, because I believe that is the best way to get surprising results.
