## Workshop Description

Creative coding is a practice where programming is used to create something expressive. Sketching is traditionally done with pencil and paper. Now, with the help of software tools such as Processing, p5.js, and openFrameworks, sketching with code has become more accessible than ever. Whether you are an artist, designer, educator, or just someone who is curious, creative coding will be a handy tool to add to your arsenal. In this workshop series, participants will learn how to write code to create digital sketches, from simple shapes to detailed visuals. By the end of this workshop series, participants will gain the basic knowledge and resources to further explore creative coding on their own. No prior coding experience required.

## Schedule

Workshop #1: Letâ€™s Start Sketching: This workshop provides an overview of creative coding and gets you started with sketching using p5.js.

Workshop #2: Repeat, Repeat, and Repeat: This workshop shows you how repetition can be used to create mesmerizing patterns and seamless transitions.

Workshop #3: Beauty of Noises: This workshop introduces you to Perlin noise, an algorithm that helps to make sketches appear more organic and natural.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the workshop series, participants will

- Be able to create both still and animated sketches using p5.js

- Have a clear understanding of the differences between different creative coding platforms

- Be able to identify the technologies required for more specialized/advanced projects

- Have a creative mindset that leads to happy accidents

- Gain essential knowledge of creative coding to further develop skills beyond this workshop series

## Teaching Methodology
This workshop series encourages participants to experiment with unconventional approaches to achieve surprising results. After each topic, the participants will be given an opportunity to practice and share. The workshop aims to intrigue and inspire participants with various topics in creative coding, and expects participants to spend time outside the workshop to branch out to other more advanced topics and further hone their skills.
