Jack B. Du is an artist and researcher whose practice centers around the experimentation of code as a creative medium. His work ranges from robotic drawings and algorithmically fabricated objects to computational visuals and embodied interactive installations. Jack’s work has been exhibited internationally at _ARTECHOUSE NYC_ (USA, 2025), _Shenzhen Design Week_ (China, 2018), _Sikka Art and Design Festival_ (UAE, 2022), and _C3 Dev Festival_ (Netherlands, 2024). He led coding workshops at _Harvard University_ (USA, 2025\) and _DigitalFUTURES_ (online/global, 2023), and delivered a featured [presentation](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av27211915/) at _Zaojiu_ (China, 2018). A selection of his work was published in the [proceedings](https://doi.org/10.1145/3615522.3615571) of _the 16th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction (VINCI ‘23)_.

Jack holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Interactive Media Arts from _NYU Shanghai_ and is currently pursuing a Master of Professional Studies degree in Interactive Telecommunications at _NYU Tisch_. Jack also serves as an adjunct professor at _NYU Tisch_, where he teaches programming and machine learning as mediums for creative expression.

## Artist Statement

I speak the language of computers. I encode my stories, emotions, curiosities, and experiences into images, animations, and interactive visuals through the relentless act of daily coding. My works are never truly finished. I am constantly on a journey of exploration, experimentation, and reiteration.

Coding as an art practice is much like painting. Code is a sequence of characters that encapsulate a creative process—conceived, revised, altered, and continually revisited. While the outcome of code is often what is seen, the code itself is like layers and layers of paints underneath a painting, easily forgotten. By sharing daily progress of my practice, I help demystify art and computation, allowing people to peek into the inner workings of my artwork.

My work often deconstructs visuals into pixelated fragments, an aesthetic rooted in nostalgia for the early days of computation and the Internet. In a capitalistic society that prizes rapid technological advancement and superhuman precision, I enjoy creating scribbly and often chaotic visuals to celebrate the poetic beauty of human imperfection and computational glitches, while also leaving space for people to decode meaning through the lens of their own lived experiences.
