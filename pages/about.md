I am an artist and researcher interested in creating images, videos, and interactive experiences with code. I am particularly drawn to creating visuals that appear pixelated and ambiguous. The uncertainty and unexpectedness is appealing to me. I also develop custom software and hardware tools for my artistic practice when they do not exist. For instance, I built [Minus E]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/minus-e/), an award-winning robotic system that creates large-scale representational drawings with scribbles, and [Mandarinizer]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/mandarinizer/), an experimental camera app that captures pictures in a pixel-art format consisting of Mandarin Chinese characters. More recently, I have been posting [coding experiments]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/daily-sketches/) daily on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jackbdu/), exploring novel possibilities of code as a creative medium.

Currently, I am working as an adjunct professor of [Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) / Interactive Media Arts (IMA)](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) at [Tisch School of Arts, New York University](https://tisch.nyu.edu). Previously, I taught [web development](https://jackbdu.com/teaching/web-development-for-absolute-beginners/) and [creative coding](https://jackbdu.com/teaching/creative-coding-for-absolute-beginners/) at New York University Abu Dhabi.

In my spare time, I like cooking. You can find photos of some of my cooking [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/cooking/).

If you want to know more about me, check out my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv/), or drop me a line at [hi@jackbdu.com](mailto:hi@jackbdu.com). I would be happy to chat with you :)
