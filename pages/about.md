I am an artist and researcher whose work explores the playful creative possibilities of computation. My ongoing project, [_Daily Sketches_]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/daily-sketches/), comprises computational sketches I create daily, where I seek to uncover meaning in the mundane, discover surprises in simplicity, and find poetry within algorithms. The 2022 compilation from this project was published in the proceedings of [_the 16th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction (VINCI ‘23)_](https://doi.org/10.1145/3615522.3615571).

My work has been exhibited at venues like _Shenzhen Design Week_, _Shanghai Science Expo_, and _Shanghai Education Expo_ in China, as well as _the Sikka Art and Design Festival_ in the UAE, the _React Summit_ and _JSNation Conferences_ in the Netherlands, the _ITP/IMA Spring_ and _Winter Shows_ in the US, among others. I have conducted workshops globally at _DigitalFUTURES_ and _Dubai Design Week_, and [delivered a feature presentation at _Zaojiu_](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av27211915/) in China.

Currently, I serve as an adjunct professor at [_NYU Tisch_](https://tisch.nyu.edu), teaching programming and machine learning as mediums for creative expression.

## Artist Statement

In a world where generative artificial intelligences strive for the highest degree of precision and realism, my artistic practice deliberately accentuates the flaws of our visual perception, embracing the beauty of ambiguity and unexpectedness.

Inspired by Chuck Close’s mosaic-style paintings and Danny Rozin’s pixel-based mechanical mirrors, my artwork often deconstructs visuals into pixelated fragments—whether it’s through [thousands of Chinese characters in a virtual mirror]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/mandarinizer/) or [the intricate scribbles drawn by a mobile robot]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/minus-e/).

Trained in computer science, I speak in the language of computer programming. I use code not much differently from how a painter uses a paintbrush, layering lines, shapes, and colors to form images. In my interactive works, I invite viewers to engage directly, to become a part of the art itself.
