I am an artist and educator interested in creating images, videos, and interactive experiences with code. I am particularly drawn to creating visuals that appear pixelated and ambiguous. I develop custom software and hardware tools for my artistic practice when they do not exist. For instance, I built [Minus E]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/minus-e/), an award-winning mobile robot that creates large-scale representational drawings in the form of large pixels of scribbles, and [Mandarinizer]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/mandarinizer/), an experimental camera application that captures pictures in a pixel-art format consisting of Mandarin Chinese characters. I post sketches I create with code daily on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jackbdu/). My work often engages with its viewers by reacting to their presence or by invoking questions, dicussions, and imaginations.

Currently, I work as an arts instructor at the [Interactive Media](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/academic-programs/interactive-media.html) program at [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/). I teach [web development](https://jackbdu.com/teaching/web-development-for-absolute-beginners/) and [creative coding](https://jackbdu.com/teaching/creative-coding-for-absolute-beginners/).

In my spare time, I like cooking. You can find photos of some of my cooking [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/cooking/).

If you would like to know more about me, check out my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv/), or drop me a line at [hi@jackbdu.com](mailto:hi@jackbdu.com). I am always happy to meet and talk to new people :)
