I am an artist and educator interested in creating images, videos, and interactive experiences with code. I am particularly drawn to creating visuals that appear pixelated and ambiguous. I develop custom software and hardware tools for my artistic practice when they do not exist. For instance, I built [Minus E]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/minus-e/), an award-winning robotic system that creates large-scale representational drawings with scribbles, and [Mandarinizer]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/mandarinizer/), an experimental camera app that captures pictures in a pixel-art format consisting of Mandarin Chinese characters. I post [sketches I create with code]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/daily-sketches/) daily on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jackbdu/) as a form of relentless experimentation and as a way to enage in conversations with the public.

Currently, I work as an arts instructor at the [Interactive Media](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/academic-programs/interactive-media.html) program at [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/). I teach [web development](https://jackbdu.com/teaching/web-development-for-absolute-beginners/) and [creative coding](https://jackbdu.com/teaching/creative-coding-for-absolute-beginners/) to total beginners.

In my spare time, I like cooking. You can find photos of some of my cooking [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/cooking/).

If you would like to know more about me, check out my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv/), or drop me a line at [hi@jackbdu.com](mailto:hi@jackbdu.com). I am always happy to meet and talk to new people :)
