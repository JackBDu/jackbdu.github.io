I am an artist and educator interested in making art with new media technologies. I develop software and hardware tools to aid my own creative process, and I hope some of them will benefit other people as well. For instance, I built [Minus E]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/minus-e/) and [Mandarinizer]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/mandarinizer/).

Currently, I am working as an arts instructor at the [Interactive Media](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/academic-programs/interactive-media.html) program at [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/).

Oh, by the way, I cook in my spare time. You can find photos of some of my cooking [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/cooking/).

If you'd like to know more about me, check out my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv/), or drop me a line at [hi@jackbdu.com](mailto:hi@jackbdu.com). I'm always happy to talk to new people and be inspired :)
