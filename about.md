I'm Jack. I love art and all things tech. That's why I built [a robot that does art]({{ site.baseurl }}/works/minus-e/).

I also enjoy teaching what I do, so I am currently working as an arts instructor of [Interactive Media](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/academic-programs/interactive-media.html) at [NYU Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/).

Oh, by the way, I cook in my spare time. You can find photos of some of my cooking [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/cooking/).

If you'd like to know more about me, check out my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv/), or drop me a line at [hi@jackbdu.com](mailto:hi@jackbdu.com). I'm always happy to talk to new people and be inspired :)
